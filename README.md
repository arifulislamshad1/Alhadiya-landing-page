## 🚀 High-Traffic & Security Best Practices

**To ensure your site is fast, secure, and ready for 50,000+ visitors:**

### Performance
- Use a caching plugin (e.g., WP Super Cache, W3 Total Cache, LiteSpeed Cache)
- Use a CDN (e.g., Cloudflare, BunnyCDN) for static assets
- Optimize images (use Smush, ShortPixel, or EWWW Image Optimizer)
- Minify and combine CSS/JS (Autoptimize plugin recommended)
- Use a reliable hosting provider with enough resources

### Security
- Keep WordPress, themes, and plugins always updated
- Use a security plugin (Wordfence, Sucuri, or iThemes Security)
- Set correct file permissions (644 for files, 755 for folders)
- Change the default database table prefix in `wp-config.php`
- Use strong, unique passwords for all admin users
- Disable XML-RPC if not needed
- Regularly back up your site (UpdraftPlus, VaultPress)
- Enable two-factor authentication for admin users

### Theme Code
- All dynamic outputs are sanitized and escaped (esc_html, esc_url, esc_attr)
- All user input is sanitized before use
- All AJAX and form requests use WordPress nonces for CSRF protection
- Device tracking and analytics are null-safe and security-hardened
